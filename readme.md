#Tick tack toe in scala
work in progress!!!

## Run the application
```shell
$ sbt
> run
$ open http://localhost:9000
```
	
- Run application like a regular Play app
  - `compile` simply triggers the Scala.js compilation
  - `run` triggers the Scala.js fastOptJS command on page refresh
  - `~compile`, `~run`, continuous compilation is also available
  - `start`, `stage` and `dist` generate the optimised javascript

based on great example [here](https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example)
